# Currency Converter Project
![Badge In Progress](http://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=STATUS&message=IN%20PROGRESS&color=orange&style=for-the-badge)

This project is a challenge I received in my technical high school class, in the mobile development course, taught by **Professor Leonardo Rocha**. It is a currency converter program for Android devices, programmed with Java in Android Studio and using the Exchange Rate API. The Retrofit library was also used to create the interface.

## Built with

- [Java](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/) - Programming Language
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=pt-br) - IDE
- [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) - Currency Converter API
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Library to create interface


## Prerequisites

First, you need to create an account on API Exchange Rate, a currency converter API that allows you to create a free trial account for use, which will provide you with the current market values of currencies.

Then, download the APK and install the application:

## Using

There is a field for entering the amount to be converted. Below it, there are two other fields, one for selecting the currency to be converted and another for selecting the currency to which it will be converted.

Just click on the **Convert** button, and nice!
