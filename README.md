# Currency Converter Project

This project is a challenge I received in class. It is a currency converter program for **Android devices**, programmed with **Java** in Android Studio and using the **Exchange Rate API**.

*The purpose of this program is only educational.*
## Prerequisites

First, you need to create an account on API Exchange Rate, one of the only APIs that allows you to create a free trial account for use, which will provide you the current market values of currencies.
